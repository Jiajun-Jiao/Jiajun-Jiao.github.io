I served as an invited engineer in technical feedback sessions for TechMBA students enrolled in the Applied Technical Foundations for Managers course at NYU Stern. These sessions simulated real-world product development meetings, where I provided feedback on no-code web application projects to help students improve technical feasibility. I participated in the mid-review on October 22 and the follow-up session on December 10, 2024.
