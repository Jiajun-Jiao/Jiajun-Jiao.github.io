I participated as an engineer in technical feedback sessions for TechMBA students enrolled in the _Applied Technical Foundations for Managers_ course at NYU Stern. The sessions involved providing feedback on no-code web application projects, simulating real-world product and feature development meetings. My contributions helped students improve the technical feasibility of their work. I will also provide additional feedback during a follow-up session on December 10, 2024.
