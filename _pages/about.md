I am an AI Product Developer at Helport AI, Inc. (Nasdaq: HPAI) and a final-year master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. I have published two papers, and my research interests span multiple domains, including multimodal learning, security, education, and medical image segmentation.

Previously, I earned a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from New York University, graduating Magna Cum Laude with a cumulative GPA of 3.91. I was on the Dean’s List from 2020 to 2024 and was recognized as an NYU University Honors Scholar. In 2023, I was named one of freeCodeCamp’s Top Open Source Contributors.
