I've been on the Dean's List from 2020 to 2024, and was selected as NYU University Honors Scholar. I was also recognized as freeCodeCamp's Top Open Source Contributors of 2023. My academic experience includes a wide range of advanced CS explores such as Algorithm, Machine Learning, DevOps & Agile, Cryptography, VR & Graphics, among others.
